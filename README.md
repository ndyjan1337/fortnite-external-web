# fortnite-external-web
Selfleak Fortnite external under the name (vatos x ndyjan) aka owl.lol V2 (updated 05.11.24)

This src is the same as the selfleak v1 (https://github.com/ndyjan1337/fortnite-external) only that it has a webbased menu hosted on https://localhost:8080

Src is not the best i know but this can be still used to understand the logic behind it (but u can play with it ofc just include ur own driver)
